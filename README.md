# ioBroker.klf200

This adapter is for controlling a VELUXÂ® KLF-200 interface. This adapter is neither an official VELUX product nor is it supported by the company that owns the VELUX products.

The main intention of this adapter is to control electric roof windows and/or electric blinds or roller shutters. Though the KLF-200 interface is able to connect to further devices like lights, switches, canvas blinds etc. I haven't developed the adapter for use with these kind of devices. Thus, it could be possible, that these devices could be controlled by this adapter, too.

The adapter works with the internal REST API of the KLF-200 interface and you don't need to 

## Setup

*TODO - not finished, yet!*

First, you have to setup your KLF-200 interface. It **must** be in the same network than ioBroker, but there is no difference if you use a WiFi connection or connect it via cable.

## User documentation

*TODO*

## Known restrictions

* The interface is restricted by storing a maximum of 32 scenes in total. 
* The REST API doesn't provide any feedback of a scene to be finished, therefore each scene is supposed to run at least 30 seconds.
* Currently, only single product scenes are supported to control from the product side. Thus, it is always possible to create scenes with several products and control them from the scenes part.
* The REST API doesn't let me read the current status of a product. Therefore the current level of a product is always what was set last and defaults to 0% on initialization of the adapter. This also means, that further logic implemented in other adapters won't work if you e.g. open or close your window with the original remote control.

## Documentation of the data points

### Devices

There are two devices: "products" and "scenes". The products device lists all registered products wether they are used in a scene or not. The scenes device lists all scenes that you have created in the interface.

#### Products

* productsFound - number of products registered in the interface
* 0...n - channel for each registered product
    * category - name of the category, e.g. Window Opener, Roller Shutter
    * scenesCount - number of scenes the product is used in
    * level - This data point is only available when the product can be controlled from a scene.
              You can set a value to run a scene that will drive the product to that specific value.

#### Scenes

* scenesFound - number of scenes found in the interface
* 0..n - channel for each scene
    * productsCount - number of products that are controlled through this scene
    * silent - true/false if the scene will run in silent mode (only, if the product supports it).
               Currently, you can only read this information.
    * run - true/false set to true to run the scene. Will change to false again after the scene has finished
